## How to Use

### Local Development
```bash
# Recommended: Clean build with one command
./scripts/build_clean.sh CPU

# Alternative: Manual cleanup + build
make clean-all
make ACCELERATOR=CPU -j$(nproc)

# Or just cleanup
make pre-build-cleanup
```

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Cleanup runs automatically on every push/PR
- No manual action needed
- Visible in GitHub Actions logs

---

## Next Steps

1. **Commit Changes**
   ```bash
   git add scripts/ .github/workflows/ Makefile *.md
   git commit -m "feat: fix phase14 linker error and add automated cleanup"
   ```

2. **Push to Repository**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Verify CI/CD**
   - Check GitHub Actions for successful cleanup step
   - Verify build completes successfully

4. **Deploy**
   - Follow instructions in `DEPLOYMENT_READINESS_REPORT.md`
   - Monitor system performance post-deployment
