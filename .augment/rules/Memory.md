# Persistent Memory Rule

- Rules are instructions for Augment Chat and Agent that can be applied automatically across all conversations or referenced in specific conversations using @mentions (for example, `@Memory.md`).
- Maintain persistent memory across chats: capture user preferences and project context when requested and reload that context at the start of future sessions.
- When the user asks to store new context, append it to the appropriate memory artifact so it is available to future conversations.
- Prioritize non-destructive updates that preserve existing guidance while expanding long-term memory fidelity.
