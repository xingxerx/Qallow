# MCP Server Setup - START HERE

## The Problem (SOLVED ‚úì)

You were seeing this error:
```
Failed to connect to "New MCP server" Error: command "cmd.exe" not found
```

**This has been completely fixed!**

## What Happened

The MCP server was configured to use `cmd.exe` (Windows command), which doesn't exist on Linux. We've now configured it to use Python on Linux instead.

## What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Restart Your IDE
- **VS Code**: Close and reopen, or press `Ctrl+Shift+P` ‚Üí "Developer: Reload Window"
- **Claude Desktop**: Close and reopen
- **Other IDEs**: Restart normally

### Step 2: Done!
The MCP server should now connect automatically. The error should be gone.

## If You Want to Verify Everything Works

Run this command:
```bash
bash /root/Qallow/verify_mcp_setup.sh
```

You should see all checks pass with ‚úì marks.
